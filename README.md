# SortingProject
The purpose of this project is compare the speed of the sorting algorithms QuickSort, Merge Sort, and Insertion sort. 


## C++ Implementation 

User inputs size of list and order of sort ( ascending or descending ). Then the program will test three different list filled with randomly generated values. After each run the program outputs the time of each sorting algorithm in seconds accurate up to 6 decimal places. After all three runs, the program outputs the rank of fastest to slowest sorting algorithm. 



## WEB Implementation 

The goal of this will be to show a visual representation of how the sorting algorithms differ from one another, both in sorting technique and time. 
The idea of to use animation of objects being organized. For this an object with attributes of an index ( used as a weight for sorting ) and a color are generated, then scrambled. The user will have the options of electing one of the three sorting algorithns as well as the option to scramble the objects.
